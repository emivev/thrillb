<h2>THE STORY SO FAR:</h2>


<h4> Thrill Engine currently is a work in progress, one man operation. Built for finding unique life changing, travel experiences, based on action sports. Only 10% ready, but already open for bookings with a purpose to understand you better and to build things that matter. The best is yet to come - <%= link_to "sign up to follow updates ", trips_path %>   </h4>

<br></br>

<h4> Ohh and if you like what you see and think you can help, just let me know. I could use some tech help.  </h4>

<br></br>

<h2>HOW IT WORKS:</h2>
<h4>  In the current version all the bookings are handled manually - just email me about booking inquiry and I’ll give you details about full pricing and availability </h4> 
<br></br>

<h4> However, if you don’t feel comfortable with the fact that this project is still largely under development, then I advise you to book directly from the property owners or similar services (just google the name of the houses). But for all the others I am open to help you find  <%= link_to "the best trip you ever had!", trips_path %> </h4>
